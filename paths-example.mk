# If you are trying to build the project on x86, you will need a copy of the
# PRU compiler and PRU support libraries installed somewhere.
#
# Once you have the compiler and libraries installed, copy this file to
# 'paths.mk' to have it automatically included in the Makefile, and edit it
# to reflect the install path of these tools on your system.
#
# Note that paths.mk is in the .gitignore, so it will not be committed.



# One possibility is that you installed these tools in your home directory.
# These paths are simply examples. Definitely change them if needed.
